## Introduction

Free random projection is a method that allows for efficient dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. This repository focuses on its application in reinforcement learning, leveraging concepts from free probability and random matrices. 

In reinforcement learning, agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Free random projection can help streamline this process by reducing the complexity of state spaces and improving the learning efficiency.

### Basic Example

Here is a simple example of how to implement free random projection in your reinforcement learning model:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from frp_rl import FreeRandomProjection

# Initialize your environment and agent here
env = create_environment()
agent = create_agent()

# Use FreeRandomProjection
frp = FreeRandomProjection(dim_input=env.observation_space.shape[0])
projected_state = frp.project(agent.state)

# Continue with the reinforcement learning loop
```

### Advanced Configuration

You can configure the parameters of the FreeRandomProjection class to suit your specific needs:

```python
